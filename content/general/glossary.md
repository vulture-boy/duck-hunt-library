### Can
The projectile used in Duck Hunt's Neutral Special, Trick Shot.

### Canicide
The act of using the explosion from Can to launch both yourself and your opponent. See [Canicide](/technique/canicide) for more details.

### Can Ownership

### Clay Shooting
[To be filled]

### Frisbee
Colloquial term for Clay Pigeon.

### Hangman
A glitch that causes Duck Hunt to stall in the air while spawning Wild Gunmen. 
The glitch performed on the Angel Platform by activating Wild Gunman within a single frame, then repeating the process using the buffer system.
See [Glitches](/technique/glitches) for more information.

### Knockback Storage
If the Can ignores the knockback of an attack (i.e. through [Can Parrying] or [Anchor Can]), it remembers (stores) the knockback of that move. 
The next time it is hit by a non-projectile, instead of taking that attack's knockback, it will release the stored knockback. 
See [Knockback Storage](/technique/knockback-storage) for more details.

### Lucina Slayer
See [Marth Slayer].

### Marth Slayer
Using [Shield Can] while next to the ledge to punish recoveries with hitboxes that extend past the floor before snapping ledge, such as Marth/Lucina's Up Specials. This could take the opponent's stock at extra high percentages.

### Perfect Can Parry
[Can Parrying] a move on the exact same frame that the move hits Can. Unlike regular Can Parry, the attacker does not take ownership of the Can, so the Can will explode if it lands on them.

### Pigeon Chain
The act of comboing a Clay Pigeon attack into subsequent Clay Pigeon attack(s).

### Ping
The gunshot from Duck Hunt's Neutral Special that makes Can do a small jump. Additionally, the shots from Duck Hunt's Smash Attacks and Side Special 'ping' Can in a similar manner to Neutral Special, instead of dealing their usual knockback.

### Pingas
An infamous patched-out glitch that resulted in the ping reticle 'doubling' on Duck Hunt's Smash Attacks if activated at the same time a Smash Attack reticle appeared.
This would effectively double the damage per hit and occasionally cause other glitches.
See [Glitches](/technique/glitches) for more information.

### Shield Can
The act of shielding in close proximity to Can such that the can's explosion hitbox will overlap with your shield. 
If the opponent hits the Can, it will instantly explode on your protective Shield and hit them if they are close enough.

### Sticky Can
Pinging Can into the wall or underside of the stage so it stalls around the ledge. This can catch recoveries or even 2-frame. 
Most effective against recovery moves with no hitboxes, especially tether recoveries.

### Stored Knockback
See [Knockback Storage]

### Updog
The combo of Down Throw into Up Air. It is true at high percentages and potentially a kill confirm, but Up Air only connects if the opponent DIs in after the Down Throw.

### Wild Gunman
Duck Hunt's Down Special. Summons one of five bagged-random Gunmen that absorb some damage and fire a thin, long horizonal projectile after a Gunman-specific timing.
