## Counterplay

### Any State
- Besides Spin Attack (Up Special), we generally have better frame data than Samus across the board.
- Samus' range with neutral attacks and the tether attack generally extend further than ours but are more committal.
- Like most heavies that struggle to get in on Duck Hunt, Samus has greater reward off successful engagement. She will likely accumulate a good deal of damage, meaning that she will have more opportunities than the average character for this.

### Neutral
- In general, our projectiles invalidate Samus' horizontal projectiles when deployed into at least midrange. 
- Because of Duck Hunt's projectile priority, it creates a situation where Samus is forced to close the distance to be effective, which her kit isn't specialized for.

### Advantage

#### Anti-Air
- Samus' Morph Ball provides a great discentive for sharking her since it reverses the situation if we're hit by the bomb and mixes up her movement with a small hurtbox.

#### Ledge Trapping
[TBA]

#### Edge Guarding

### Disadvantage

#### Offstage

#### Overstage
[TBA]

#### On Ledge
- Samus' biggest advantage in the MU is that she has a very effective ledgetrap game involving the use of Morph Ball Bomb to force a ledge option that can be covered with FSmash or a large Charge Shot.

### Projectile Effectiveness

### Samus' Missiles

- Samus' Homing Missile will aim towards an opponent's centre of mass, regardless of how far away they are.
  - The Homing missile can only travel at an angle +/- 30 degrees [approx] from horizontal.
  - If there is no target, the Homing Missile will fly straight without changing trajectory (i.e. keep its current angle).
  - Because of the homing properties, if the can is positioned <=1/3 of the grounded distance from Samus to Duck Hunt, the homing missile will not make contact with the Can.
- Samus' Super Missle is a fast horizontal projectile that moves very slightly upward as it flies.
  - Super Missile will travel about the length of Battlefield before exploding on its own. This explosion does have a hurtbox.
  - At a distance of about 5 units from Samus (1/3 of Battlefield), a Can will low profile the Super Missile.
  - At a distance of about 7 units from Samus (almost 1/2 of Battlefield), Duck Hunt can duck beneath the projectile.
  - Novelty: At a distance of about 12.5 units from Samus, Duck Hunt can low profile the projectile with his ear scratch idle animation. This is about the distance from the ledge to the end of the far platform (Idles trigger every 2-6 seconds).

#### Trick Shot
- Power Beam affects can differently depending on the level of charge. [would benefit from a visual aid]
  - Uncharged and nearly uncharged power beam shots will not hit the can on the ground.
  - Midair cans are affected by power beam knockback and will be sent at a very horizontal angle.
  - Power beam charge shots over two seconds of charge that hit a grounded can will send it over Duck Hunt if he is at spawning distance.
- Morph Ball Bomb moves the can at about ping's distance away from itself.
- Anchor can properties apply to all of samus' projectiles.

#### Clay Pigeon
- Clay Pigeon eliminates all charge shots safely provided that it is far enough away / not to not explode on Duck Hunt, which Samus can utilize for a fallback combo. Weak charge shot will be tanked by Clay Pigeon [confirm states / staleness].
- Clay Pigeon also eliminates both Missiles, but Samus has very marginally (a few frames) more advantage off the interaction and can use it as an opening for a followup Charge Shot, so it is not an indefinite solution. [please confirm]

#### Wild Gunman
- Gunman can tank a weak charge shot [and homing missile? confirm]
