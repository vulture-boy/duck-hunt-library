## Summary
[no description available]
[Link last updated in Version 13.0.1]

## Counterplay

### Any State
- Be careful about the hurtbox displacement and timing on Link's DA and FSmash
- Link has Sword Beams at 0%.
- Hylian shield is active when Link is stationary and walking. It will tank ALL of DHD's projectiles and detonates Can safely. However, it's coverage is limited to a region directly in front of Link; it doesn't protect his head or his feet.

### Link's Bomb
- 39 frame pull.
- Bomb detonation is a friendly fire explosion.
- Bomb self-destructs after 30 seconds (It flashes slightly faster on the last second but it's barely perceptible).
- Hogging bomb reduces Link's ability to effectively zone vs DHD and it can be abused as a throwable item vs Link.
- Bomb explodes as a product of Can's explosive fire element (if the can lands on the bomb or self-destructs).
- Bomb bounces on its stage proportionally relative to the speed it makes contact with a surface. If it's overlapping the can, it will knock the can away on the bounce fall too.
- Bomb rolls when overlapping a hurtbox.
- Link must hit bomb with a disjoint or outside of the initial grab window to move it, otherwise he will pick it up (e.g. with FTilt).
- Bomb can be thrown at an opponent as a means of potentially trapping opponents in an item pickup animation before going for a grab. [[demo by JforJonas]](https://youtu.be/CyYhe442dHU)

### Neutral
- Jab: Up Smash OOS if adjacent, or dash grab
- Link benefits from the safety of plats when making bomb or boomerang pulls.
- Link's arrows and boomerang interrupt CP's endlag positively for us.
- Link's Nair leads into dtilt (and faster moves) on shield faster than we can challenge it OOS. [confirm frame advantage]
- Parry and pivot grabs are effective tools vs Nair.
- Be mindful of (or take advantage of) z drop item combos with Bomb.
- Link's FTilt effectively spaces opponents on connect with shield.
- You can avoid followups from a down throw at mid percents by jumping away.
- If Link's bomb is within reachable distance, you can make an effort to grab it and eliminate its usefulness as an onstage zoning tool (it can't explode while held).
  - Link can call out opponents for trying to abuse pickup Bomb, either via detonation or normals; if this happens, you may consider moving in the relative (i.e. not necessarially direct) direction of the bomb to eliminate its presence or improve your positioning.
- Link's bomb can be hit with an attack like Can, which can punish Link for greedy detonations or at least displace it.
- Aerial attack approches can be punished on shield with Link's UpB OOS; if trying for an approaching FAir, try to hit low enough that you can followup with a low profiling DTilt...
- Grounded UpB is a common OOS option and punish. Our DTilt and FSmash [others?] happen to low profile it, which gives us an opportunity to counter-punish if they choose this option in error.

### Advantage

**Anti-Air**
- Watch out for Link's disjointed Dair. The sword pogos on contact while the move is active, so be wary of followup hits.
- You can contest Link's Dair attempts if you perform UAir from the side without hitting the hitbox with the duck.
- Can is generally strong as an anti air option.

**Ledge Trapping**
- Standard stage trapping with Can support is relatively effective.
- Link may choose to protect a jump with rising nair or, as a risky mixup, UpB.
- You can use CP explosion to two-frame Link's low recovery effectively. [[video demonstrating from Pyro-Is-Magic's edgeguard guide]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR230bKVIgo&t=253s)

**Edge Guarding**
- Sending can towards Link is fairly safe due to his lack of recovery mixups outside Bomb.
- Be very careful about physically approaching Link when he's offstage as it is very easy to be reversaled by Link's UpB. The move is vulnerable from Link's head, but Link chooses when to activate it. Consider trying to bait out the move so that you can safely access its vulnerabilities.
- If deep enough, you may be able to disrupt a bomb recovery attempt with a normal.
- Link is vulnerable to offstage Canicide guards (though probably not worth the risk).
- Link's bomb can be used by Link to restore his recovery, sending at a slightly low diagonal angle. He very likely will end up over the stage or on the other side.

### Disadvantage

**Offstage**
- We are very vulnerable to bomb when recovering from low as it generally disregards our projectile projection attempts.
- The bomb can be used to provide vertical distance to Duck Hunt depending on its relative position, which can potentially put Duck Hunt in a safer position at the expense of damage.
- Watch out for dropdown Up Special, which Link can use to cover the stage wall.

**Overstage**
- Be careful about performing moves above stage as Link can intercept with lingering Up B or disjointed UAir and secure stocks.

**On Ledge**
- Link's DSmash KO's with no DI between 84-98% depending on rage as tested on FD.
- You can dropdown and z-catch bomb if it presents a ledge threat.

### Stage Selection
- Links prefer to have some platforms as protection from Gunman and Can.

### Combo Windows

**Duck Hunt Combo Windows**
- Pre-Tumble CP Loops: Shorthop 45% -> 79% Max [[link]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DVdmKkSD33fJ-Iz9DO0Pyiv4Q6gVXA9DcUoD1uZTKX8/edit?gid=0)
- Very Hard to Dragdown UpAir -> UpTilt / UpSmash. Inconsistent (need back hit). [[link]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TaQLYoPKJ6rVN3Uk-VucRwV9jwKXFCB2VywxqzCNU1Y/edit?gid=0)
- CP -> fullhop BAir at ~120% [need to verify ranges & details]

**Opponent Combo Windows**
- Z Bomb Drop -> Footstool -> Detonate -> Dair [low end of 0-60%?] [[link - video by Sillintor]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQvryN7GJjM)
- S. Nair -> opponent slips off ledge -> Runoff FAir [%?]

### Projectile Effectiveness

**Trick Shot**
- Not displaced significantly by arrow or boomerang
- Its fire element can detonate bomb if it lands on bomb, but not if it's caught in a bomb explosion.
- Can will not detonate bomb if the ping hits the bomb first or by simply touching the bomb.
- Can will move in the direction Link was facing when he threw the boomerang if the boomerang makes contact with the can, regardless of the direction the boomerang is moving.
- Can will move in the direction the Bomb was dropped if it's hit by a bomb explosion.
- You can use an fsmash KB storage to have the can sent across the stage towards a camping Link. [[link]](https://clips.twitch.tv/BigHungryDonutBabyRage-DkAVBKuX7zhSOaqA)

**Clay Pigeon**
- Link's arrows and boomerang interrupt CP's endlag positively for us.
- The CP can tank boomerang [confirm?]

**Wild Gunman**
- Link can disrupt Gunman with bomb detonation, returning boomerang and Nair among other tools.
- Gunman can survive an arrow, a forward moving boomerang and the Bomb's item hitbox. [how much?]

## Opponent Counterplay
*Some comments sourced from [a MU discussion video between Link players J, Jama & Rex on Duck Hunt, June 21st, 2021](https://youtu.be/KAjbYIQBex0?si=fuJoXo6wAXv-Ka1S&t=5920)*

- Be cautious about whiffing attacks into aerials as Link is easily juggled by DHD's attacks.
