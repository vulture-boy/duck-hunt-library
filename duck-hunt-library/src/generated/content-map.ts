It is, however, very punishable on shield if called out or performed away from a corner situation.</li>\n<li>DK has a top 10 walk speed, slightly faster than ours.</li>\n<li>If DK can reach FTilt range, Dashing &#x26; Shielding can be a viable option for them to protect against Can detonations and close space.</li>\n<li>While DK can struggle to get in for a grab, once the grab happens he can lead into very advantageous stages or kills thanks to Cargo Throw.</li>\n<li>With enough shield pressure our smash attacks can also shield poke.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Advantage</h3>\n<p>Anti-Air</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UAir and Can are effective tools at covering airspace vs DK. Look out for falling airdodges.</li>\n<li>They may throw out a DAir (or even reverse-movement Down Specials) as a mixup, but otherwise UAir and Can should win most interactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ledge Trapping</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DK should be vulnerable to most of our standard grounded ledgeguarding strategies and will probably prefer to jump if possible.</li>\n<li>DK's aerial Spinning Kong Up B can knock away Can safely.</li>\n<li>DK's ledge jump if performed straight up gives DK more height to mix up his landing.</li>\n<li>DK could use a Giant Punch Neutral Special as a last resort mixup due to its armor properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Edge Guarding</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can go for deep attacks vs DK since contesting them puts DK at risk of not getting back to stage.</li>\n<li>DK is vulnerable to Canicide abuse as an edgeguard. <a href=\"https://fixupx.com/SirpoSpin/status/1814282009906176438\">[link]</a></li>\n<li>Recovering from high when coming from offstage may be preferable to DK's other options if they believe it is safer than risking being edgeguarded; think about where they might want to go after being hit.</li>\n<li>When DK is at higher percents, dropping Gunman at ledge can cover horizontal space and hitstun Spinning Kong Up B.</li>\n<li>Dair is somewhat risky for us from the side as DK can mixup the timing of his Up Special; you may want to consider covering the horizontal range with a projectile trap instead, which could place DK at a more punishable position.</li>\n<li>(That being said, if DK has already committed to the Up B or comes into contact with a dropped Gunman then the DAir should be free)</li>\n<li>Watch out for DK trying to deliberately land on a platform from offstage as it can be a gateway to mixup options (fallthrough BAir, grab?).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Disadvantage</h3>\n<p>Offstage</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard Can-aided recovery is very effective at covering our ledge approach and blocking out DK's several meteor attacks &#x26; Bair.</li>\n<li>Getting Cargo Thrown offstage puts us into a dangerous situation where our options for self-defensive recovery vs DK are reduced.</li>\n<li>Careful not to spawn can too late if DK is chasing offstage (e.g. Bair or Nair).</li>\n<li>DK has access to airborne Hand Slap ('aHS', Down Special), Dair, Side Special and Fair as potential meteor options, each with their own utility attributes.</li>\n<li>DK can use Dair on a ledgebound can to send it downwards. <a href=\"https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxFdKuLsDBBmdWBXHD7TKoUmokoNOCJ0Wl\">[example w/ Falcon Dair]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overstage</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Donkey Kong is very strong at playing an anti-air game vs us; avoid this situation.</li>\n<li>Donkey Kong's Up Air beats our aerials cleanly; don't contest the move.</li>\n<li>We can use a descending can (e.g. via Dair Can) to help protect our descent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On Ledge</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Airborne spinning kong, if we tech it, can be followed up from ledge by one of DK's meteors. [please confirm this]</li>\n<li>Donkey Kong's ledge covering attacks include DTilt, FTilt [more?]</li>\n<li>DK's Down Special and tilts can cover ground options, and Bair + UAir can cover jump. He can also convert grabs into dangerous advantage situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stage Selection</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Donkey Kong prefers platforms and stage bases that allow him to maneuver around Duck Hunt's projectiles.</li>\n<li>The DK Discord considers Final Destination as the worst stage for the MU, as a total absence of platforms gives DK minimal options to move around projectiles.</li>\n<li>Battlefield and Smashville give us strong trapping coverage as the give us large swaths of projectile coverage with little space to circumnavigate them and vulnerability to our anti-airs.</li>\n<li>Wide stages generally give Donkey Kong more space to position against DHD's toolset. This includes T&#x26;C and Kalos, which boast side and moving platforms that DK can work around unlike FD.</li>\n<li>DK is a heavyweight that does not struggle to kill in varying blast zones; smaller blast zones to allows us to score kills earlier, meaning fewer opportunities for openings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Combo Windows</h3>\n<p>Duck Hunt Combo Windows</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to Dragdown UpAir -> UpTilt / UpSmash <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TaQLYoPKJ6rVN3Uk-VucRwV9jwKXFCB2VywxqzCNU1Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0\">[link]</a></li>\n<li>DK is vulnerable to jablock CP combos in all states EXCEPT <a href=\"https://x.com/pyro_magic/status/1376843403250389000/photo/1\">if you throw CP between his legs</a>.</li>\n<li>You can peform Can Reticle ping pong combos and score high damage with good execution. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByceL64/status/1352647628861939717?s=20\">[link]</a></li>\n<li>CP -> fullhop BAir ~170% [need more data]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Opponent Combo Windows</p>\n<p><em>Notes from this section are largely verbatim from the DK discord.<br>\npDKO and variants are also colliquially known as the 'Ding-Dong' combo.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>pDKO: [60] 62 - 69 (Cargo Throw -> Jump -> Toss above platform -> Jump x2 -> UpAir)</li>\n<li>gDKO: N/A (pDKO but Cargo Throw Up while grounded)</li>\n<li>aDKO: N/A (pDKO but without a platform)</li>\n<li>apDKO: [46] 47 - 57 (pDKO but already on the platform)</li>\n<li>d-tilt trip: 0 - 66.6</li>\n<li>d-tilt trip (max rage): 0 - 55.4</li>\n<li>Headbutt -> USmash: N/A</li>\n<li>aerial down special (aHS) -> USmash: 65 - 92 [82+ untechable]</li>\n<li>Dash Attack vs Ledge Hang: Yes, Spaced</li>\n<li>smash vs Ledge: Yes</li>\n<li>Dair through Platform: None</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<p>Game Start and Angel Platform</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[no notes available]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Timeout Considerations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[no notes available]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sudden Death</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[no notes available]</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Projectile Effectiveness</h3>\n<p>Trick Shot</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Donkey Kong's FTilt (particularly Pivoted and Tipper) is effective at safely protecting space vs Can and knocking it towards an adjacent DHD.</li>\n<li>Fairly good escape for some untrue early % DK combos, which can put DK into a convenient position for DHD.</li>\n<li>Generally great for protecting our recovery vs DK.</li>\n<li>KO's DK ~190% on Battlefield when fresh.</li>\n<li>Stationary can on platforms makes it very difficult for DK to jump.</li>\n<li>DK can DAir can from above when we are offstage, potentially hitting us if we're below.</li>\n<li>You can peform Can Reticle ping pong combos and score high damage with good execution. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByceL64/status/1352647628861939717?s=20\">[link]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clay Shooting</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undetonated pigeon clanks vs gSK (Grounded Spinning Kong, DK's Up Special)</li>\n<li>Disrupts the super armour of gSK if detonated correctly.</li>\n<li>Takes very little shield damage to poke through Donkey Kong's shield.</li>\n<li>DK is in the CP pre-tumble chain short hop 45% group.

The projectiles are only frame 1 if DHD is hit, otherwise they become active on f16 (Can) and f17 (CP).</li>\n<li>Use Ftilt (ideally pivoted and tipper) to protect space vs Can and knock away Gunmen. Possible to hit DHD at the same time either directly or with the can.</li>\n<li>Bair is also effective for knocking away Can if FTilt is not an option.</li>\n<li>Dash &#x26; Shield to protect yourself against a detonating or f1 spawning can.</li>\n<li>Short hop over Clay Pigeon; the move has 64 frames of endlag</li>\n<li>Movement is generally more effective than shielding; only shield if at about FTilt distance.</li>\n<li>Force DHD into corner situations to strip options as a priority over direct hits.</li>\n<li>Duck Hunt is vulnerable above the stage, so create opportunities for this via vertical launchers; their best options in the situation are airdodge and falling can, since DK's UAir cleanly beats all of DHD's aerials in advantage.</li>\n<li>Good options for corner pressure include Bair, Nair, Shield grab, Pivot FTilt, DTilt and grounded Down Special</li>\n<li>Edgeguarding DHD is difficult if they have the opportunity to spawn Can; consider setting up offstage situations with Cargo Throw or BAir them before they have time to spawn it. DK can also DAir the can.</li>\n<li>Beware landing and ledgerolling into DHD's disjointed smash attacks.</li>\n<li>DHD's earlier kill options are commonly high UAirs, ledge BAirs, and smash attacks. Otherwise, expect to live past 200%</li>\n<li>Because of DHD's low kill potential you can abuse max rage, likely taking stocks sub 50 with Giant Punch</li>\n<li>Provided the can is not primed inwards, being between DHD and the can means that DHD cannot protect himself with it (though it can still be used in combo chains)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recommended VODs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy9RSXSbJHg\">CaKe (Duck Hunt) vs ChunkyKong (Donkey Kong) - Get On My Level, Toronto CANADA, May 18th 2024</a>\n<ul>\n<li>ChunkyKong is recognized not only as a top level Donkey Kong, but also for having extensively studied the matchup ahead of the set. CaKe demonstrates how Duck Hunt can absolutely seize control of neutral in the matchup with careful technical positioning, oppressive traps and anti airs but ChunkyKong keeps games close and ultimately claims the last game by immediately capitalizing on risky openings into strong advantage states, cornering situations and kill confirms.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZCK4Ku4ZZT8?t=1946\">Raito (Duck Hunt) vs HIKARU (Donkey Kong) - RyoToKotu [lit.

We particularly don't want the latter to be sent back to us as it can create dangerous disadvantage states.</li>\n<li>If Dedede sucks, spawning Can and immediately shielding at close range will blow up Dedede with the benefit of the added multiplier.</li>\n<li>Gunman is relatively safe at midrange as Dedede cannot bypass it without risky maneuvers like DTilt or tilts/jab. Use with movement to start engagements and plan for combos e.g. with plat-Can.</li>\n<li>Both characters have relatively strong advantage states against eachother.</li>\n<li>UAir is great for juggling, but watch out for Nair in the air, which is F7.</li>\n<li>If shielding Dedede's jab, when DHD is only being hit by the stub outside the barrel of Dedede's hammer, releasing shield can result into a parry (or leave DHD outside of Jab's range). You can use this opportunity to punish with a CP. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5S3_aUfC5fI?feature=shared&#x26;t=198\">[demo by embo_z]</a></li>\n<li>If Dedede air camps, wait for him to land.

Pengu-win plays to get in quickly for Nairs, grabs, and high impact swings while embo_z initiates from midrange into multiple consecutive hits, punishing Dedede's Suck with can into shield and openings (e.g. from Jab) into long CP chains. Can parry setups on can at the start of stocks help keep the can positioned on stage. Pengu-win gets some chains off Nairs and uses Suck midair and aerials off ledge to keep can and ledge pressure off.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_-g1EbKTLI\">Katamari [かたまり] (Duck Hunt) vs Garuku [ガルク] (King Dedede) - Mar 12th, 2023</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Katamari's VOD with Garuku demonstrates more standard gameplay VS Dedede; Katamari controls space with typical Duck Hunt techniques and Garuku reveals Dedede's ability to challenge them and more standard play for a heavyweight challenging a control zoner. Katamari uses CP more liberally than embo, demonstrating its use as a shield pressure tool as well as Dedede's ability to challenge bad tosses. Garuku demonstrates some of Dedede's more common ledgetrap techniques including Jet Hammer and sweeping hammer aerials. Garuku succeeds in getting in with the aid of advancing shield and capitalizing on Katamari's spacing when Duck Hunt attempts to make unsafe plays at about a quarter stage's distance. Katamari's use of Gunman as a backup shield for a grounded can helps avoid reversal situations, though arguably less effective than embo's strategy of shielding expected can Sucks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n<p>Written and compiled by Vultures<br>\nNot peer reviewed</p>\n",

  "technique/canicide": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Canicide is the act of using the explosion from Trick Shot's Can to launch yourself into an ideally advantageous or mixup situation.</p>\n<p>It can also describe an erroneous self-explosion, however this article and most discussions on the term concern the effective use of Canicide to Duck Hunt or their opponent's advantage.</p>\n<p>Since Canicide requires the explosion of the can, you generally need to either get the can into an overheat state or an explosion trigger (e.g. your opponent) to create the explosion.</p>\n<p>Because Canicide is self-inflicting, it has the obvious downside of doing damage to Duck Hunt, eliminating the Can from stage and having to setup the conditions for it to explode.</p>\n<p>However, since the Canicide 'hits' Duck Hunt, they recover their actions and exit endlag as if they were hit by an opponent and travel along the knockback path of the can explosion.</p>\n<p>This article covers three core Canicide concepts and their counterplays: Movement (and Recovery), Defense, and Combos.</p>\n<h2>Canicide Movement and Recovery</h2>\n<p>Canicide Recovery and Movement concern the use of Canicide to move Duck Hunt on the stage without afflicting the opponent.</p>\n<p>At high percents, you can use it to move across the stage very quickly along the Can's knockback path at the cost of damage and hitstun.</p>\n<p>You can also use it to restore your recovery options. This can be used after performing Duck Jump in extreme offstage situations, though because of Duck Hunt's already large recovery distance and the difficulty of lining up with the Can's overheat state, this is both difficult to pull off and not often practical.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/media/duck_hunt_canicide_recovery.mp4\">Canicide Recovery Rhythm Example</a> by Tater</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Counterplay</h3>\n<p>Canicide Recoveries are generally a last resort due to their technical difficulty and tight trajectory.</p>\n<p>Like a regular Can Recovery, the Can will be in a close position to Duck Hunt during Duck Jump and may protect them, but they will ultimately need to connect themselves with the Can overheat state.</p>\n<p>Depending on your character's skillset, you could potentially remove the can or punish their linear flight path, since they have to follow the pinging of the can to be in its range when it explodes.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you can simply wait for their following action and position, since the explosion will effectively keep them in Disadvantage state.</p>\n<p>Be careful not to be caught in a reversal situation by the explosion.</p>\n<h2>Canicide Defense</h2>\n<p>Canicide Defense is the use of the Can to disincentivise your opponent from attacking you during stun states or high hitlag moves.</p>\n<p>The explosion of the can will interrupt stun situations and can allow you to exit endlag, but it can also disincentivize opponents from punishing as the presence of an incoming can alone presents the threat of explosion.</p>\n<p>The explosion will interrupt paralysis, bury, trip, sleep [and others?].</p>\n<p>With Canicide Defense, you present the possibility of a Canicide whether or not it actually occurs, which is a strength itself.</p>\n",

The CP follows a relatively linear path, descending with a light gravity and air friction factor.</p>\n<p>While the CP is active on screen, the CP can be 'fired upon' by pressing Neutral Special to shoot the projectile with Reticles.</p>\n<p>It must be fired upon up to three times to detonate until the CP makes contact, stops, or despawns after a period of inactivity. While active, Duck Hunt loses control of Trick Shot as shots are directed instead towards the CP.</p>\n<p>You can 'Hard Toss' the CP with a 'smash' input, sending the CP moving fast, or 'Soft Toss' the CP with a more gentle Side Special input, sending the CP moving slower.</p>\n<h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The move takes 17 frames to spawn the Clay Pigeon unless interrupted by an attack, in which case it spawns on frame 1 and can burst on contact.</li>\n<li>The move takes overall 64 frames to complete; the move is slow and can easily be punished if evaded or reflected.</li>\n<li>Activating Side B when you expect to be hit with a projectile during the 17 frame startup allows for you to spawn Clay Pigeon and generally exit your hitlag earlier, allowing you to perform follow ups earlier.</li>\n<li>The startup of the Clay Pigeon toss has a hitbox (which can be useful for chaining combos).</li>\n<li>The spawning of Clay Pigeon can be B-Reversed and Wavebounced. The resulting movement is fairly dynamic.</li>\n<li>The clay pigeon will last 3 seconds motionless before despawning.</li>\n<li>Duck Hunt or the opponent can destroy the clay pigeon with an attack, which will cause it to shatter if it does enough damage and produce its explosion hitbox under their ownership.</li>\n<li>The individual chip-like damage of the explosion particles have little hitstun.</li>\n<li>The Clay Pigeon explosions cannot be SDI'd in a meaningful manner due to the properties of the explosion having a combination of no hitstun and/or no SDI multiplier.</li>\n<li>The ability to escape a Clay Pigeon attack or combo depends on whether or not the opponent is caught within the full detonation sequence (and sometimes startup attack), whether the attack leads into a tumble state, or whether the attack launches the opponent far enough away to avoid subsequent chaining.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Clay Pigeon Chains &#x26; Starters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Clay Pigeons can be chained sequentially provided that the opponent can be reached in time for follow-up hits (i.e percent, size and weight dependent).</li>\n<li>Clay Pigeon chains usually involve a gradual ascension, requiring the use of jumps to make successive hits.</li>\n<li>In few cases, characters will be chainable on the ground which can lead to kill confirms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Written and compiled by Vultures<br>\nNot peer reviewed</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/vulture-boy/duck-hunt-ssbu/issues/5\">GitHub Task: Contribute Suggestions Here!</a></p>\n",

  "technique/knockback-storage": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Knockback storage is a unique property of Duck Hunt's can where the amount of knockback from an attack is stored until the can is hit again.</p>\n<p>The property is triggered if the can is hit at the same time as a 'ping', the crosshair projectile created either from activating Trick Shot or from one of Duck Hunt's Smash Attacks.</p>\n<p>Rather than being affected by the stored attack's usual knockback, the can ignores the knockback effect and follows its current trajectory, or the connecting hit trajectory of Duck Hunt's smash attacks.</p>\n<p>After knockback is stored in the can, it will not be reset until it is either hit, pocketed or destroyed.</p>\n<p>The property of 'ignoring' the initial hit's knockback is sometimes called a Can Parry and can be used to absorb the impact of attacks from you or your opponent (not to be confused with parrying the can).</p>\n<p>Knockback storage has no bearing on the direction that the Can is facing, so the Can will continue to ping relative to the direction the attacker was facing when they hit the can.</p>\n<h2>Priming the Can</h2>\n<p>You can 'prime' the can with attacks by inputting an attack and pressing Special the same frame it is hit. Once it is primed, you can use any attack, including Jab 1, to activate the knockback.</p>\n<p>Common Use Cases:\r\n[To be filled]</p>\n<p>Niche Use Cases:\r\n[To be filled]</p>\n<h2>Opponent Counterplay</h2>\n<p>If the can doesn't 'move' upon being hit by you or the opponent Duck Hunt's attack, chances are that it has been affected by the knockback storage property.</p>\n<p>The above reference list covers the effects that Duck Hunt's attacks have on the attack, but generally speaking if you are familiar with the knockback angles and intensity of you and your oppoents attacks, you should be able to predict where the can will be sent on following attacks. Knowing the precise angle for storage is a large scope concept but having situational awareness of the phenomenon should help you avoid most situations.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind that other properties of Can still apply, including the direction that it will ping on being attacked and the ability for Duck Hunt to ping the can on frame 1 when it is under their control.</p>\n<p>The best time to abuse knockback storage against Duck Hunt is in the niche situation where it has been primed you can displace it without being in the knockback trajectory angle or being hit by a ping, such as with a disjointed attack or if a Clay Pigeon is present (since Duck Hunt cannot ping the can at this time).</p>\n<p>The Knockback Storage of the can does not have a significant effect on gameplay until it is launched with an activating attack, so it should only be able to be triggered remotely from Duck Hunt via their other projectiles (probably Wild Gunman) or your own attacks.</p>\n<p>The technique is somewhat advanced; beginner Duck Hunts will probably trigger or use this property by complete accident or prime it with a smash attack that ultimately puts them in a lot of endlag. Use this opportunity to gain stage control if possible or abuse this property against them where applicable.</p>\n",

The action of spawning the projectile lasts 16 frames of a total 39 frames of endlag.</p>\n<p>The Can is active on frame 1 of the move, meaning the spawn can be interrupted by an opponent's attack resulting in an explosion.</p>\n<p>Opponents caught in the explosion will be sent at a relatively 45 degree upward angle facing in the direction they are from the can.</p>\n<p>After the projectile spawning period is complete, the Can can be 'pinged' every 12 frames up to a maximum of 9 times.</p>\n<p>After receiving 9 pings, a certain amount [?%] of damage or after a certain amount [?] of time, the can will enter an 'Overheat' state that increases its damage, knockback and makes it unaffected by attacks until it self destructs after approximately 2.5 seconds.</p>\n<p>Pinging the Can results in a 'reticle' appearing over the Can the same frame it is pinged that also causes damage to the opponent with knockback in the direction that Duck Hunt is facing.</p>\n<p>The Can will always move in the direction that the character who last hit or created it was facing.</p>\n<h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Can as a connective element to extend or create combo chains. For example, you could hit the opponent with an aerial into the can and catch them at the position they are sent, or throw them into the can as a potential KO technique.</li>\n<li>Hitting the can with BAir will make the can ping towards you.</li>\n<li>Hitting the can with vertically aligned moves such as DAir and UAir will generally reverse the direction it pings.</li>\n<li>As opponents are not always aware of the direction that the can will move when pinged, you can cover space adjacent to the can if you expect them to airdodge to avoid the Can's movement.</li>\n<li>You can use the Can as a combo breaker as it creates great separation between the opponent and the user at frame 1 upon contact, assuming the opponent is in the final spawn position at the time of contact.</li>\n<li>You can also use the explosion of the can on you and your opponent to lead to a followup attack. This is called a Canicide Combo (and isn't usually true but is often unexpected). <a href=\"/technique/canicide\">[read more]</a></li>\n<li>When the can spwaning is interrupted, it becomes full scale at the position it would be if the animation completed. If the position is occupied by a solid (such as Steve's blocks or a slope), it will move itself to a best-fit position.</li>\n<li>Shield Can is a popular technique of setting the can adjacent to your shield, such that it can be detonated when the opponent attempts to hit you.</li>\n<li>If a projectile hits the Can, the can will ping in the direction the character was facing when the projectile was created. For example, Link's boomerang will make the can face the direction it was initially thrown, even if it's returning to sender.</li>\n</ul>\n",
  "technique/wild-gunman": "<h2>External Resources</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ssbwiki.com/Wild_Gunman\">Wild Gunman's SSBWiki Entry</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ultimateframedata.com/duck_hunt.php\">Duck Hunt's UltimateFrameData Page</a></p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Wild Gunman is Duck Hunt's down special, which summons one of five different gunman in front of the user that fires a raycast bullet horizontally after a set amount of time before despawning.</p>\n<p>Each of the five gunmen have different firing heights, damage, knockback angles, and health. The gunmen are summoned from a randomized bag, meaning all five must appear before they are shuffled and drawn again.</p>\n<p>After receiving enough damage, the gunmen will be 'defeated', leaving them in a stationary 'shocked state' or knocking them over; this causes them to despawn after a longer period of time.</p>\n<p>Because only one gunman may be active at a time, this effectively delays Duck Hunt's ability to summon subsequent gunmen.</p>\n<h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The gunman can be used as a light defensive shield, which is particularly effective against weak attacks. This can also stuff certain attack-based recoveries such as PK Thunder.</li>\n<li>The gunman is effective at covering horizontal space, which is useful for conditioning shield, briefly covering ledge options, or long distance pressure.</li>\n<li>Because of the long and reactable startup time, Gunman is not usually used in neutral to hit the opponent but rather cover space and force them to either shield or relocate.</li>\n<li>If gunman is triggered at the edge of a ledge, it will fall slowly until it fires or touches the ground as if it were summoned midair.</li>\n<li>Common counterplay to a grounded gunman includes runup attacks and grabs, which generally can defeat the gunman pre-fire or be performed outside of its threat range.</li>\n<li>An opponent hitting a gunman with an attack has hitstun, meaning it can be used to extend the length of incoming attack's frames. You can take advantage of this to punish certain attacks, such as falling aerials.</li>\n<li>'Gunman Break': The gunman's shot will interrupt a grab or attack (e.g. jab) by either player. For Duck Hunt, this can potentially lead into followup attacks based on the position of the opponent during the throw's animation. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9D0s-pE8cw\">[demo]</a></li>\n<li>'Rapid Jab Lock': Fastfallers hit by a Skinny gunman's Gunman Break can be hit by the rear hitbox of Duck Hunt's rapid jab and be locked in a near-infinite jab string. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9D0s-pE8cw&#x26;t=211\">[demo, 3:31]</a></li>\n<li>You can use Gunman's hurtbox to as a means of hitbox extension, similar to Wario's Bike.</li>\n<li>The black gunman shoots over the can on level ground, while all other gunman hit the can.</li>\n<li>Gunmen shots will hit projectiles in front of them.</li>\n<li>The distance of a gunman's shot travels to the lesser of its maximum length and the distance to the closest object in its firing line; it does not pass through objects.</li>\n<li>The sombrero gunman's shot has fire element.</li>\n<li>A reflected gunman bullet will usually travel near or just past the center of their own body, which is often just barely long enough to hit Duck Hunt from the summoning position.</li>\n</ul>\n",

This has been properly applied to normal gameplay in 9.0.0.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_updates_(SSBU)/2.0.0_changelog#Duck_Hunt\">2.0.0 - 30 Jan 2019</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>NEUTRAL SPECIAL - Trick Shot has less endlag (FAF 46 -> 42).</li>\n<li>SIDE SPECIAL - Clay Shooting has more endlag (FAF 61 -> 64).</li>\n<li>SIDE SPECIAL - Clay Shooting causes less hitlag (1x -> 0.5x/0.2x (hit 1/2-3)).</li>\n<li>GLITCH - Fixed a game crash where Wild Gunman and the Mii Swordfighter's special moves were used at the same time.</li>\n<li>GLITCH - Corrupt save data occurs if Duck Hunt plays Century Smash.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_updates_(SSBU)/1.2.0_changelog#Duck_Hunt\">1.2.0 - 14 Dec 2018</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[Reportedly Duck Hunt adjustments, but unknown what has changed.]</li>\n<li>ITEMS (UNIVERSAL) - It is no longer possible to z-drop items out of hitstun.</li>\n<li>UNIVERSAL - The x0.85 shorthop aerial damage multiplier when doing shorthop -> land -> fullhop -> aerial has been removed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_updates_(SSBU)/1.1.0_changelog\">1.1.0 - 07 Dec 2018</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>UNIVERSAL - The AI for various characters has been adjusted.</li>\n<li>UNIVERSAL/GLITCH - Fixed a glitch causing throws in Training Mode to gradually reduce knockback taken by the victim if the Fixed Damage option was turned on, even to the point of them taking no knockback.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.0.0 - 07 Dec 2018</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UNIVERSAL - Initial Release [changes from Smash 4?]</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pre-Release</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(no data)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Outstanding Questions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How did Duck Hunt develop during Smash 4?</li>\n<li>Are there any interesting observations of Duck Hunt during Beta and Pre-Release releases and demonstrations?</li>\n<li>Are there any undocumented patch changes that are insider information within the Duck Hunt Discord?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n<p>Written and compiled by Vultures<br>\nNot peer reviewed</p>\n",
