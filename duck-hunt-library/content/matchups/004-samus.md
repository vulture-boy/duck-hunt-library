## Summary
[no description available]

## Counterplay

### Projectile Properties

- Samus' Homing Missile will aim towards an opponent's centre of mass, regardless of how far away they are.
  - The Homing missile can only travel at an angle +/- 30 degrees [approx] from horizontal.
  - If there is no target, the Homing Missile will fly straight without changing trajectory (i.e. keep its current angle).
  - Because of the homing properties, if the can is positioned <=1/3 of the grounded distance from Samus to Duck Hunt, the homing missile will not make contact with the Can.
- Samus' Super Missle is a fast horizontal projectile that moves very slightly upward as it flies.
  - Super Missile will travel about the length of Battlefield before exploding on its own. This explosion does have a hurtbox.
  - At a distance of about 5 units from Samus (1/3 of Battlefield), a Can will low profile the Super Missile.
  - At a distance of about 7 units from Samus (almost 1/2 of Battlefield), Duck Hunt can duck beneath the projectile.
  - Novelty: At a distance of about 12.5 units from Samus, Duck Hunt can low profile the projectile with his ear scratch idle animation. This is about the distance from the ledge to the end of the far platform (Idles trigger every 2-6 seconds).

### Projectile Effectiveness

**Trick Shot**
- Power Beam affects can differently depending on the level of charge. [would benefit from a visual aid]
  - Uncharged and nearly uncharged power beam shots will not hit the can on the ground.
  - Midair cans are affected by power beam knockback and will be sent at a very horizontal angle.
  - Power beam charge shots over two seconds of charge that hit a grounded can will send it over Duck Hunt if he is at spawning distance.
- Morph Ball Bomb moves the can at about ping's distance away from itself.
- Anchor can properties apply to all of samus' projectiles.
