## Summary

Knockback storage is a unique property of Duck Hunt's can where the amount of knockback from an attack is stored until the can is hit again.

The property is triggered if the can is hit at the same time as a 'ping', the crosshair projectile created either from activating Trick Shot or from one of Duck Hunt's Smash Attacks. 

Rather than being affected by the stored attack's usual knockback, the can ignores the knockback effect and follows its current trajectory, or the connecting hit trajectory of Duck Hunt's smash attacks.

After knockback is stored in the can, it will not be reset until it is either hit, pocketed or destroyed.

The property of 'ignoring' the initial hit's knockback is sometimes called a Can Parry and can be used to absorb the impact of attacks from you or your opponent (not to be confused with parrying the can).

Knockback storage has no bearing on the direction that the Can is facing, so the Can will continue to ping relative to the direction the attacker was facing when they hit the can.

## Priming the Can

You can 'prime' the can with attacks by inputting an attack and pressing Special the same frame it is hit. Once it is primed, you can use any attack, including Jab 1, to activate the knockback.

## Opponent Counterplay

If the can doesn't 'move' upon being hit by you or the opponent Duck Hunt's attack, chances are that it has been affected by the knockback storage property. 

The above reference list covers the effects that Duck Hunt's attacks have on the attack, but generally speaking if you are familiar with the knockback angles and intensity of you and your oppoents attacks, you should be able to predict where the can will be sent on following attacks. Knowing the precise angle for storage is a large scope concept but having situational awareness of the phenomenon should help you avoid most situations.

Bear in mind that other properties of Can still apply, including the direction that it will ping on being attacked and the ability for Duck Hunt to ping the can on frame 1 when it is under their control.

The best time to abuse knockback storage against Duck Hunt is in the niche situation where it has been primed you can displace it without being in the knockback trajectory angle or being hit by a ping, such as with a disjointed attack or if a Clay Pigeon is present (since Duck Hunt cannot ping the can at this time).

The Knockback Storage of the can does not have a significant effect on gameplay until it is launched with an activating attack, so it should only be able to be triggered remotely from Duck Hunt via their other projectiles (probably Wild Gunman) or your own attacks.

The technique is somewhat advanced; beginner Duck Hunts will probably trigger or use this property by complete accident or prime it with a smash attack that ultimately puts them in a lot of endlag. Use this opportunity to gain stage control if possible or abuse this property against them where applicable.
