## Summary

Canicide is the act of using the explosion from Trick Shot's Can to launch yourself into an ideally advantageous or mixup situation. 

It can also describe an erroneous self-explosion, however this article and most discussions on the term concern the effective use of Canicide to Duck Hunt or their opponent's advantage. 

Since Canicide requires the explosion of the can, you generally need to either get the can into an overheat state or an explosion trigger (e.g. your opponent) to create the explosion. 

Because Canicide is self-inflicting, it has the obvious downside of doing damage to Duck Hunt, eliminating the Can from stage and having to setup the conditions for it to explode. 

However, since the Canicide 'hits' Duck Hunt, they recover their actions and exit endlag as if they were hit by an opponent and travel along the knockback path of the can explosion.           

This article covers three core Canicide concepts and their counterplays: Movement (and Recovery), Defense, and Combos.

## Canicide Movement and Recovery

Canicide Recovery and Movement concern the use of Canicide to move Duck Hunt on the stage without afflicting the opponent. 

At high percents, you can use it to move across the stage very quickly along the Can's knockback path at the cost of damage and hitstun. 

You can also use it to restore your recovery options. This can be used after performing Duck Jump in extreme offstage situations, though because of Duck Hunt's already large recovery distance and the difficulty of lining up with the Can's overheat state, this is both difficult to pull off and not often practical.

### Counterplay

Canicide Recoveries are generally a last resort due to their technical difficulty and tight trajectory. 

Like a regular Can Recovery, the Can will be in a close position to Duck Hunt during Duck Jump and may protect them, but they will ultimately need to connect themselves with the Can overheat state. 

Depending on your character's skillset, you could potentially remove the can or punish their linear flight path, since they have to follow the pinging of the can to be in its range when it explodes. 

Alternatively you can simply wait for their following action and position, since the explosion will effectively keep them in Disadvantage state.

Be careful not to be caught in a reversal situation by the explosion.

## Canicide Defense

Canicide Defense is the use of the Can to disincentivise your opponent from attacking you during stun states or high hitlag moves. 

The explosion of the can will interrupt stun situations and can allow you to exit endlag, but it can also disincentivize opponents from punishing as the presence of an incoming can alone presents the threat of explosion. 

The explosion will interrupt paralysis, bury, trip, sleep [and others?]. 

With Canicide Defense, you present the possibility of a Canicide whether or not it actually occurs, which is a strength itself.
