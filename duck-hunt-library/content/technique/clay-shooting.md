## Summary

Clay Shooting is Duck Hunt's Side Special.   

Clay Shooting spawns a projectile called Clay Pigeon (colliquially referred to as CP, frisbee, and disk). The CP follows a relatively linear path, descending with a light gravity and air friction factor. 

While the CP is active on screen, the CP can be 'fired upon' by pressing Neutral Special to shoot the projectile with Reticles. 

It must be fired upon up to three times to detonate until the CP makes contact, stops, or despawns after a period of inactivity. While active, Duck Hunt loses control of Trick Shot as shots are directed instead towards the CP. 

You can 'Hard Toss' the CP with a 'smash' input, sending the CP moving fast, or 'Soft Toss' the CP with a more gentle Side Special input, sending the CP moving slower.

## Additional Notes

- The move takes 17 frames to spawn the Clay Pigeon unless interrupted by an attack, in which case it spawns on frame 1 and can burst on contact.
- The move takes overall 64 frames to complete; the move is slow and can easily be punished if evaded or reflected.
- Activating Side B when you expect to be hit with a projectile during the 17 frame startup allows for you to spawn Clay Pigeon and generally exit your hitlag earlier, allowing you to perform follow ups earlier.
- The startup of the Clay Pigeon toss has a hitbox (which can be useful for chaining combos).
- The spawning of Clay Pigeon can be B-Reversed and Wavebounced. The resulting movement is fairly dynamic.
- The clay pigeon will last 3 seconds motionless before despawning.
- Duck Hunt or the opponent can destroy the clay pigeon with an attack, which will cause it to shatter if it does enough damage and produce its explosion hitbox under their ownership.
- The individual chip-like damage of the explosion particles have little hitstun.
- The Clay Pigeon explosions cannot be SDI'd in a meaningful manner due to the properties of the explosion having a combination of no hitstun and/or no SDI multiplier.
- The ability to escape a Clay Pigeon attack or combo depends on whether or not the opponent is caught within the full detonation sequence (and sometimes startup attack), whether the attack leads into a tumble state, or whether the attack launches the opponent far enough away to avoid subsequent chaining.

## Clay Pigeon Chains & Starters

- Clay Pigeons can be chained sequentially provided that the opponent can be reached in time for follow-up hits (i.e percent, size and weight dependent).
- Clay Pigeon chains usually involve a gradual ascension, requiring the use of jumps to make successive hits.
- In few cases, characters will be chainable on the ground which can lead to kill confirms.
